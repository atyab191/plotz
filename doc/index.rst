PlotZ
=====

`PlotZ` aimz at producing publication-quality plots for inclusion in LaTeX
documents. It is designed to be as simple to use as possible, with a Python API
allowing to produce, post-process and plot your data in the same
environment. `PlotZ` actually produces TikZ code, that will seamlessly integrate
in your LaTeX documents/presentations. The provided command allows resizing
`PlotZ` images on the fly, so that your picture will always come right, whether
it appears as a small subfigure in a paper or in a Beamer slide.

Examples of `PlotZ` figures are available in the Gallery_. These pages contain a
more formal and systematic documentation of the python API for `PlotZ`.
